CS 170 Fall 2019 Project

## Project Discription
Designed an approximation algorithm for the following NP complete problem: Given a graph of locations + all TAs' homes, the professor of CS170 drives and drops TAs off closer to their homes so that they can all get back to their homes. The goal is to plan transportation so that everyone can get home and the professor goes back to the starting point as efficiently as possible. Each TA can walk a road with some edge cost and the professor can drive a road carrying all TAs with 2/3 the cost of a TA walking.
